# Credit-Card-Payment-Simulator
A web page which replicates a real world scenario of an online transaction, including verifying the credit card information
and storing the information to the database.
#
The directory named 'Coursework 3' is the main soure code which contains all the html/php pages and javascript etc. However, having access to
the source code alone will do you no good as the web pages must be hosted somewhere. Hence, I have decided to use the web server program called XAMPP which
allows you to host web pages locally. I have also included a copy of the XAMPP (Standalone) program file in this repository which I have used to host my web pages.

-------------------------------------------------- -----------------INSTRUCTIONS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to get the source code up and running you must follow some steps...
1) As mentioned above I have included the xampp program file which you must download in order to host the web pages on your local server.
2) Find the sub-directory 'htdocs' inside 'xampp' directory
3) Download and move the 'Coursework 3' directory into 'htdocs'
4) You must now switch on the xampp server...Run the program named 'xampp-control.exe' located in the same directory as 'htdocs' 
5) Press start for the modules: 'Apache' and 'MySQL', then wait till both the modules turn green (indicating successful connection).
