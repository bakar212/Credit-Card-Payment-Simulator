# Credit-Card-Payment-Simulator
A web page which replicates a real world scenario of an online transaction, including verifying the credit card information
and storing the information to the database.
#
The directory named 'Coursework 3' is the main soure code which contains all the html/php pages and javascript etc. However, having access to
the source code alone will do you no good as the web pages must be hosted somewhere. Hence, I have decided to use the web server program called XAMPP which
allows you to host web pages locally. I have also included a copy of the XAMPP (Standalone) program file in this repository which I have used to host my web pages.
